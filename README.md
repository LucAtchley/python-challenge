Election and Financial Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the results of an election and the financial information of a bank. For the election database, I looped through the data to produce the total votes, percentage of votes won by the
candidates, and the winner of the election. For the banking analysis, I looped through the data to produce total months, total amount of money, average change in capital, greatest increase in profit, and the
greatest decrease in profit. 

To produce this data:
1: I imported cvs and os to get the right libraries.
2: I used for loops to analyze the database.
3: I used print to create a table that shows the results.

This project is important because it shows how to use python to analyze large databases.

My tutor, Fred Logan, helped me with contributing to this project.
